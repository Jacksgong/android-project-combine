# Android Project Combine

Combine multiple android projects on one Android Studio window.

## WHAT ABOUT THIS?

> This is very useful when you developing several projects but they need to communicate each other(such as Atlas project)

- Just a developing env wrapper, it can't modify projects, safe to use.
- Different Android projects develop together at the one Android Studio window.
- Find References and Jump into source code rather than .class file on jar package.
- Jump out of the each projects compile system and using the official compile system.
- Very light, very fast for each time you want to refresh combine project.

## HOW TO USE?

#### Step 1. Create `repos.conf` File

> P.S. You can refer to `/repos.templete.conf`

You need create `repos.conf` file on project root directory, and declare which repo you want to combine on it(one line one repo address).

```yml
# import FileDownloader porject
git@github.com:lingochamp/FileDownloader.git
# declare the FileDownloader exposed arr with groupId:artifactId
- exposed: com.liulishuo.filedownloader:library
# declare ignore the module with its folder name 'demo'
- ignore-module: demo
# declare ignore the module with its folder name 'demo2'
- ignore-module: demo2

# import filedownloader okhttp3 connection project
git@github.com:Jacksgong/filedownloader-okhttp3-connection.git

# import Demo project on ~/Downloads/Demo folder
~/Downloads/Demo
```

> As you can see above, we can recognize repos address and local absolute path.

#### Step 2. Refresh env

Execute `./refresh.sh` to refresh env

#### Step 3. Open on the Android Studio

Open android-project-combine on the Android Studio.
